    <string name="about_pcos">PCOS (also called the Stein-Leventhal syndrome), is an endocrine and metabolic disorder
        that affects women of reproductive age. A state of hormonal imbalance in the body takes place when a male
        hormoneâ€“androgen is produced much above normal levels which lead to the disruption in the development and the
        release of eggs during ovulation; hirsutism; acne and the growth of cysts on the ovaries. It affects the normal
        metabolic process which is indicated by abrupt weight gain and tiredness among PCOS patients.

    <string name="purpose">Polycystic Ovary Syndrome (PCOS) has become as common as common cold these days in women
        aging towards puberty. Living with PCOS can be both embarrassing and anxiety-ridden, as symptoms ranging from
        the growth of facial hair to infertility affect women from the outside and inside. Risk factors associated with
        PCOS are Infertility or Subfertility, Endometrial Cancer (Endometrial Carcinoma), Diabetes, Lipid Abnormalities,
        Cardiovascular Risks. According to [4], women diagnosed with PCOS are twice as likely to be hospitalized for
        heart disease, diabetes, mental health conditions, reproductive disorders, and cancer of the uterine lining.
